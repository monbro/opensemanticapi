opensemanticapi
===============

**Works with NodeJS, Restify, UnderscoreJS and Redis**

**Description**

Will allow you to create your own semantic wording database with redis. Otherwise there will be a open api to get related words by meaning. You could say, this implementation is a light version of the idea behind http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis

**Examples**

The following examples where given after the system was collecting for about one hour only.

**1. Example (http://localhost:8080/relations/ship):**

* Input: "ship"

* Output: ["midshipmen", "aboard", "ships", "rating", "master", "served", "seaman", "sea", "officers", "santa", "sailing", "cadets", "able", "sail", "navigation", "lieutenant", "hms", "expected", "yahoo", "storm", "rated", "promotion", "maría", "lewis", "false", "era", "boys", "wind", "voyage", "volunteer", "servants", "required", "passing", "palos"]

**2. Example (http://localhost:8080/relations/human):**

* Input: "human"

* Output: ["humans", "evolution", "primates", "ago", "ado", "studies", "physiology", "bonobo"]

**3. Example (http://localhost:8080/relations/dog):**

* Input: "dog"

* Output: ["infant", "wildlife", "offspring", "mother", "future", "southwest", "koalas", "conflict", "animals", "aitken", "wolf", "urban", "rehabilitation", "pet", "perspective", "nursing", "mexico", "evolutionary", "weaning", "ticket", "texas", "speech", "special", "retrospective", "primate", "holtcamp", "fund", "enough", "domestic", "cost", "arizona", "210–217", "variety", "trivers", "trauma", "terms", "sprawl", "southwestern", "sense", "river", "received", "questions", "point", "perhaps", "parent", "otter", "makes", "little", "less", "himself", "gray", "gorilla", "frequently"]

**Installation Guide**

* install npm and node if you have not already (http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm or http://nodejs.org/)
* install / start your redis server (http://redis.io/topics/quickstart) on a disk with several free GB

* clone this repo "git clone https://github.com/monbro/opensemanticapi.git"
* change config if needed in "/config.js"
* NOTE: depending on what you want (scraper / cronjob to run or http api server, set 'http_server' to true or false)
* open the repository folder in your console
* enter "npm install", it will install all dependencies automatically
* start the node server with "node app.js"
* now it should print what it is collecting or what http route is requested
* the longer it collects data the better the results should be
* now you can access the relations through your browser like http://localhost:8080/relations/database or direct by accessing your redis server

**To Do:**

* improve performance of script
* allow certain configurations (half done)
* try to use http://yeoman.io/ with its structure for more compatibility and understanding
* write tests
* connect to travis-ci
* better folder structure
* write version using level db or similar
